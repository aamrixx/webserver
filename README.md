# webserver

This is my own personal webserver. It is a work in progress so don't expect much.
There are things that I need to do to make this better.

# Todo
- [x] Run a page
- [x] JSON config file
- [ ] Multi-Threading
- [ ] A tiny shell for commands
- [ ] Multi-Page support

# Usage
Simply run cargo run in the folder then type ``127.0.0.1:7878`` in your browser.
